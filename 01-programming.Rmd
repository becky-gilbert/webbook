# Programming for the Web

This chapter provides a high-level overview of programming for the web. It is intended for readers who have never done any web development. It covers the core concepts of web-based programming, which can be mysterious for new web developers. It also explains how websites are published and gives some advice about the tools that you will want to have on your computer to support effective web development.

This chapter won't teach you how to program. However, it should make learning to program a bit easier by clarifying how all the pieces of a website fit together. Chapter 2 won't assume that you have any programming experience, so one way to learn is to build the experiments in this book, perhaps experimenting with changes to the examples to test and extend your knowledge. Another approach would be to spend some time learning the basics of web programming before moving on to Chapter 2. There are plenty of high-quality online courses and tutorials that teach the basics.

## How a website works

When you open a browser and type in the URL of this book (http://book.jspsych.org) lots of things have to happen in order for you to see the website. A connection is established between your computer and another computer that "serves" the website. One or more files are then transferred from the server to your computer. These files include HTML documents, CSS stylesheets, JavaScript files, and media elements like audio files and images. As a developer, your role is to create all of the files that are needed to render the website as you want it.

A crticial point to remember as a new web developer is that it is the job of the web browser to transform this set of files into a website. As a developer, you are providing a (very detailed) "recipe" and the browser is assembling the final dish. Fortunately, browsers are far more precise than chefs and usually websites look the same regardless of which browser is doing the rendering. This is thanks to a commonly agreed upon set of standards that browser developers follow. However, these standards have some ambiguity and as a result there are times when a website will look exactly like you want it to in one browser but not in another.

## The three languages of web development 

One of the challenging aspects of web development is that the programmer needs to know three different languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each language is responsible for a different kind of information that the web browser needs in order to render the final website. HTML defines the structure of the elements on a website, such as the presence of text and images. CSS controls how those elements look. If you want to change the size of an image, the color of a background, or the font of a paragraph, you'll be using CSS. HTML and CSS are both markup languages. **[Need description of what that means]**. JavaScript, on the other hand, is a true programming language. In addition to all the normal kinds of computation that programming langauges generally allow, JavaScript is especially good at interacting with HTML and CSS. JavaScript can manipulate the HTML and CSS of a website, allowing the programmer to specify rules about when certain elements on the page should be added or removed (manipulating HTML) and when their appearance should change (manipulating CSS). These interactions can produce very simple results, such as changing the size of an image when the user clicks on it, or very complex ones, such as the development of a video game entirely in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

To create a simple experiment in jsPsych, you only need to have a basic familiarity with JavaScript. There is minimal HTML and CSS in the first few experiments in this book. However, if you want maximal flexibility over what content is in the screen and how it appears, you will need to become familiar with HTML and CSS. As you will discover, jsPsych is designed to allow users who are comfortable manipulating HTML and CSS full control over the output. **[possible figure here with two different jsPsych examples, one simple one fancy]**.

### HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) defines the elements that exist on a webpage. For example, the HTML below defines two paragraphs.

```html
<p>This is the text in paragraph one.</p>
<p>This is the text in paragraph two.</p>
```

HTML uses *tags* -- like `<p>` and `</p>` above -- to define elements. The type of element is defined by the text in the tag. `<p>` tags create paragraphs, `<img>` tags create images, and `<audio>` tags create audio. Elements begin with the type of element in `< >` brackets, and end with the same tag plus a backslash: `</ >`.

HTML defines **a lot** of different elements. **[maybe a link here?]**. But you don't need to know all or even most of these to get started with HTML. As long as you understand a few ideas about how to use HTML, you'll be able to understand HTML markup and modify it to suit your needs.
