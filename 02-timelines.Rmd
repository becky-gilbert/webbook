# The jsPsych Timeline

This chapter describes...

## Setting up your first experiment

This section is a mini-tutorial that explains how to setup a very basic jsPsych experiment. The goal is to quickly get an experiment running so that you can see what a complete working experiment involves. Explanations of why certain steps are being taken are deliberately brief, and subsequent sections of this chapter will go into more detail.

### Step 1. Create a folder for your experiment.

Pick any location on your computer and create a new folder. You can call the folder whatever you like, such as `FirstExperiment`. 

Inside this folder create another folder called `jspsych`. 

### Step 2. Download the jsPsych library.

The jsPsych library is hosted on GitHub at [https://github.com/jspsych/jspsych](https://github.com/jspsych/jspsych). You can download the latest release on the [releases page](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/releases) of the GitHub repository. Under each release you will see three files. Two are `Source Code (zip)` and `Source Code (tar.gz)`. The other begins with `jspsych-` and ends with a version number. At the time of writing, the current release is `v6.0.5` so the file to download is `jspsych-6.0.5.zip`.

Once this file has downloaded, open the ZIP archive and move all of the files to the `jspsych` folder that you created in the previous step.

### Step 3. Create a new HTML file.

Open your coding-friendly text editor of choice (see SECTION 1.XXX if you don't have an editor) and create a new file. In this file, create a [minimal HTML] document using the following code.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
  <script>
  </script>
</html>
```

Save this file as `experiment.html` inside the `FirstExperiment` folder.

### Step 4. Load the jsPsych library.

Recall from SECTION XXX that JavaScript can be loaded from external `.js` files by including a `<script>` tag in the `<head>` section of an HTML document. To load jsPsych, add a `<script>` tag to the `experiment.html` file, with the `src` attribute linking to the `jspsych.js` file in the `jspsych` folder.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="jspsych/jspsych.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
  <script>
  </script>
</html>
```

*something here about folder paths?*

At least one plugin file is required to create an experiment. Load the `html-button-response` plugin by adding a `<script>` tag that points to the `jspsych-html-button-response.js` file in the `jspsych/plugins` folder. 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="jspsych/jspsych.js"></script>
    <script src="jspsych/plugins/jspsych-html-button-response.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
  <script>
  </script>
</html>
```

Note that plugins should always be loaded after the main `jspsych.js` file is loaded.

### Step 5. Create a welcome screen.

This simple experiment will a single screen, welcoming the participant to the experiment. There will be a button that the participant can click to continue (which will end the experiment). 

To create the welcome screen, create a JavaScript object called `welcome`. The object needs a few parameters, shown below. This code can be placed inside the `<script></script>` section of the HTML file.

```js
var welcome = {
  type: 'html-keyboard-response',
  stimulus: 'Welcome to the experiment!',
  choices: ['Continue']
}
```

The `type` parameter tells jsPsych which plugin is being used to construct the trial. In Step 4, you added a `<script>` tag to load the `html-button-response` plugin, and now the plugin is being used to construct this trial.

Each plugin has a set of parameters. Two of the parameters for the `html-button-response` plugin are `stimulus` and `choices`. `stimulus` controls what content is displayed on the screen above the button. The plugin expects the stimulus to be a `string`, which may include HTML tags. `choices` is an `array` of labels for the buttons. In this example, there is a single button with the label `'Continue'`.


### Step 6. Create a timeline and add the welcome screen.

A jsPsych experiment is defined by its _timeline_. The timeline is covered in depth later in this chapter. For now, think of the timeline as an ordered list of trials. After a trial is complete, the experiment progresses to the next trial in the timeline.

The jsPsych timeline is created by adding trial objects, like the `welcome` object above, to an array. Create an empty array, and then add the `welcome` object like this.

```js
var timeline = [];

timeline.push(welcome);
```

### Step 7. Start the experiment!

Once the timeline is created the experiment can begin. To start the experiment, call the function `jsPsych.init()`. This function takes an object of parameters. The only _required_ parameter is `timeline`. The value of this parameter is the array created in the previous step.

```js
jsPsych.init({
  timeline: timeline
});
```

### The completed experiment.

Here's what the completed code looks like:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="jspsych/jspsych.js"></script>
    <script src="jspsych/plugins/jspsych-html-button-response.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
  <script>
  
    var welcome = {
      type: 'html-keyboard-response',
      stimulus: 'Welcome to the experiment!',
      choices: ['Continue']
    }
    
    var timeline = [];
    
    timeline.push(welcome);
    
    jsPsych.init({
      timeline: timeline
    });
  
  </script>
</html>
```

You can run the experiment by opening the `experiment.html` file with a web browser. The window below shows a running version of the experiment.

## How does a jsPsych experiment work?

As shown in the previous section, experiments in jsPsych are created by specifying a timeline. Timelines contain a set of ordered trials, and each trial is associated with a particular plugin. When the experiment runs, the core jsPsych code (in `jspsych.js`) parses the timeline and determines what the next trial on the timeline is. The code then calls the plugin, passing it all the parameters specified in the trial object, and the plugin gains control of the experiment. The plugin can then specify what happens on the screen. When the plugin is done, it sends control back to the core jsPsych library to determine what the next trial is and which plugin should have control.

This section goes into detail about basic features of plugins and timelines. Advanced features are covered in later chapters with experiments that require more complicated timeline and plugin designs.

### Plugins 

Plugins define the basic tasks that are available in a jsPsych experiment. 

- what every plugin does (start, stop, collect data)
- kinds of plugins
  - advantages of generic and specific plugins
- how to use a plugin
  - docs and syntax
  - default parameters

### The timeline

- array of trials
- executed in order
- how to create a timeline in code (style guide).
- pointer to advanced features (single paragraph).

### Static and dynamic parameters

- KEY IDEA: most of the code that you are writing runs before the experiment even begins.
- need simple situation where we want dynamic parameter (but need a few more concepts... so maybe this moves to next chapter, and we do big 5 there. or do it again?
