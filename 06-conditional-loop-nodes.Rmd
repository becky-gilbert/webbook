# Conditional Nodes and Loop Nodes

## Experiment: Semantic Priming

Key topics covered:
- Using loop nodes to repeat a timeline, based on data collected during the experiment
- Using conditional nodes to run or skip a timeline, based on data collected during the experiment
- Combining loop and conditional nodes to repeat a set of practice trials until a minimum performance level is achieved

Other topics covered:
- Importing trial variables from a CSV file (CSV-to-JSON conversion)
- Using jsPsych's factorial function to dynamically create a full set of trial variables 
- Pseudo-randomizing the trial order
