["index.html", "Online Behavioral Experiments with jsPsych Welcome", " Online Behavioral Experiments with jsPsych Joshua R. de Leeuw Welcome This book will teach you how to create behavioral experiments using jsPsych. jsPsych is a JavaScript-based framework for developing experiments that run in a web browser. Any device with a modern web browser installed (e.g., desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones) can run jsPsych experiments. Experiments can be delivered via a web server for online participants, or run locally on a computer in a laboratory. Each chapter of this book illustrates a key feature or set of related features of jsPsych by walking you through the creation of a real experiment from the cognitive science literature. If you are brand new to jsPsych (or web-based programming in general), it’s recommended that you work through the chapters in order. Experiments later in the book build off the concepts introduced by earlier experiments. If you are already familiar with jsPsych and are looking to learn about a specific technique, each chapter should be sufficiently self-contained that you can jump around.

["programming-for-the-web.html", "1 Programming for the Web", " 1 Programming for the Web This chapter provides a conceptual overview of programming for the web. It is intended for readers who have done little or no web development. It covers the core concepts of web-based programming, which can be mysterious for new web developers. It also explains how websites are published and gives some advice about the tools that you will want to have on your computer to support effective web development. This chapter won’t teach you how to program. However, it should make learning to program a bit easier by clarifying how all the pieces of a website interact together. This chapter does aim to give you enough background knowledge that you can start building the experiments in this book. One way to learn how to program for the web is to build the experiments in this book, tinkering with them to test and extend your knowledge. Another approach is to read this chapter for the overview and then invest some time learning the basics of programming for the web by completing one of the many high-quality online courses/tutorials. I won’t try and provide specific course and tutorial recommendations here, given how frequently they appear and change, but a quick search should be sufficient to find many good options. "],
["how-a-website-works.html", "1.1 How a website works", " 1.1 How a website works When you open a browser and type in the URL of this book (http://book.jspsych.org) lots of things have to happen in order for you to see the website. A connection is established between your computer and another computer that “serves” the website. One or more files are then transferred from the server to your computer. These files include HTML documents, CSS stylesheets, JavaScript files, and media elements like audio files and images. As a developer, your role is to create all of the files that are needed to render the website as you want it. A crticial point to remember as a new web developer is that it is the job of the web browser to transform this set of files into a website. As a developer, you are providing a (very detailed) “recipe” and the browser is assembling the final dish. This might seem a bit troubling. If three chefs were given the same recipe the results might be noticably different. Fortunately, browsers are far more precise than chefs and usually websites look the same regardless of which browser is doing the rendering. This is thanks to a commonly agreed upon set of standards that browser developers follow. However, these standards have some ambiguity and as a result there are times when a website will look exactly like you want it to in one browser but not in another. 1.1.1 “Front end” and “Back end” Two (or more) computers are involved when a website is requested: The computer that the viewer of the website is using and one or more computers that are serving the website. Programming for the web is conceptually divided based on which of the computers is running the code. If the code is running on the viewer’s computer, it’s front-end development. If it is running on the computer serving the website, it’s back-end development. This chapter focuses on front-end web development. This kind of web development focuses on what the viewer of the website sees and how they interact with the website. It involves HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Back-end development is focused on programs that run on the computer(s) serving the website. These programs typically handle tasks that require access to data stored on the server. For data-rich websites, most of the programming is back-end focused. There are many programming languages that can be used for back-end development. For a typical online experiment, most of the programming is focused on the front end. As researchers, we need to control what the user is seeing or hearing, and how they are interacting with the experiment. These are tasks that are controlled by front-end development. One aspect of back-end programming that experiments do need to handle is data storage. JavaScript (running on the participant’s computer) can record data from an experiment, but in order to store the data on the researcher’s server back-end programming is necessary. Fortunately, these back-end scripts are interchangeable for jsPsych experiments. [Chapter X] provides a sample data saving script that should work for any jsPsych experiment. "],
["three-languages-of-the-web.html", "1.2 Three languages of the web", " 1.2 Three languages of the web One of the challenging aspects of web development is that the programmer needs to know three different languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each language is responsible for a different kind of information that the web browser needs in order to render the final website. HTML defines the structure of the elements on a website, such as the presence of text and images. CSS controls how those elements look. If you want to change the size of an image, the color of a background, or the font of a paragraph, you’ll be using CSS. HTML and CSS are both markup languages. [Need description of what that means]. JavaScript, on the other hand, is a true programming language. In addition to all the normal kinds of computation that programming langauges generally allow, JavaScript is especially good at interacting with HTML and CSS. JavaScript can manipulate the HTML and CSS of a website, allowing the programmer to specify rules about when certain elements on the page should be added or removed (manipulating HTML) and when their appearance should change (manipulating CSS). These interactions can produce very simple results, such as changing the size of an image when the user clicks on it, or very complex ones, such as the development of a video game entirely in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. To create a simple experiment in jsPsych, you only need to have a basic familiarity with JavaScript. There is minimal HTML and CSS in the first few experiments in this book. However, if you want maximal flexibility over what content is in the screen and how it appears, you will need to become familiar with HTML and CSS. As you will discover, jsPsych is designed to allow users who are comfortable manipulating HTML and CSS full control over the output. [possible figure here with two different jsPsych examples, one simple one fancy]. 1.2.1 HTML HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) defines the elements that exist on a webpage. For example, the HTML below defines two paragraphs. &lt;p&gt;This is the text in paragraph one.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is the text in paragraph two.&lt;/p&gt; HTML uses tags – like &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt; above – to define elements. The type of element is defined by the text in the tag. &lt;p&gt; tags create paragraphs, &lt;img&gt; tags create images, and &lt;audio&gt; tags create audio. Elements begin with the type of element in &lt; &gt; brackets, and end with the same tag plus a backslash: &lt;/ &gt;. HTML defines a lot of different elements. [maybe a link here?]. But you don’t need to know all or even most of these to get started with HTML. As long as you understand a few ideas about how to use HTML, you’ll be able to understand HTML markup and modify it to suit your needs. 1.2.1.1 HTML attributes HTML tags often have additional attributes that control additional properties of the element. One attribute of the &lt;img&gt; tag is the src, which defines the source of the image. The &lt;img&gt; tag below has the src attribute set to the URL of the jsPsych logo. &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.jspsych.org/img/jspsych-logo.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt; Attributes are declared by putting a space between the tag name and the attribute name and = after the attribute. The value to the right of the = will be assigned to that attribute. Tags can have multiple attributes separated by a space. The alt attribute for an img tag is used to describe the alternate text that would replace the image for users using screen readers or other assistive devices. &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.jspsych.org/img/jspsych-logo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;jsPsych logo&quot;&gt;&lt;/img&gt; Two very useful attributes to know are id and class. These are both ways to identify elements on the page so that JavaScript and CSS can interact with them more easily. id values should typically be unique, and are used when CSS or JavaScript needs to target one particular element on a page. class values can be applied to many elements on a page, and are used when CSS or JavaScript needs to interact with all the instances of a particular set of elements. 1.2.1.2 Nesting elements in HTML Elements in HTML can be nested within other elements. For example, a link to another website may be nested within a paragraph. &lt;p&gt;Please see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jspsych.org&quot;&gt;jsPsych documentation&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt; An important aspect of nesting elements is that the inner-most element (&lt;a&gt; above) must be closed before the element that contains it is closed. The following is wrong because the &lt;p&gt; element is closed before &lt;a&gt;, but &lt;a&gt; started after &lt;p&gt;. &lt;p&gt;Visit &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jspsych.org&quot;&gt;jsPsych.org&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Nesting allows HTML to naturally reflect the hierarchical structure of a webpage. Webpages often have distinct sections, like navigation and content, that contain many elements. The &lt;div&gt; element is used to create arbitrary divisions of the page. &lt;div id=&quot;table-of-contents&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;chapter-1.html&quot;&gt;Chapter 1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;chapter-2.html&quot;&gt;Chapter 2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div id=&quot;content&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;It all began...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And then ...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The end.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; 1.2.1.3 A bare-bones HTML document. If you create a text file with a few words in it, save it as a .html file, and open it in a web browser you’ll find that it is displayed as a web page. In some sense, a file of text is a minimal HTML file. However, most HTML files have a standard set of sections that look something like this. &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;A bare-bones HTML document&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; The above has a few HTML-elements, &lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt;, &lt;title&gt;, and &lt;body&gt;, as well as something that looks like an HTML element – &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; but is actually a declaration to the web browser about what kind of document this is and what the root element of the document is. In this case &lt;html&gt; serves as the root element, which is standard practice. &lt;head&gt; defines the head-section of the document, which can contain information about the page that is not directly rendered in the visible page. An example of this is the &lt;title&gt; element, which controls the title that is displayed in the window or tab of the web browser. &lt;body&gt; is the element that contains all of the content that will be displayed. 1.2.2 CSS CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a markup language that defines the visual appearance of elements on a webpage. For example, this CSS rule declares that all text in &lt;p&gt; tags will be displayed with a 24px font and in red. p { font-size: 24px; color: red; } CSS rules require the use of a selector. The selector defines the set of elements that the rule applies to. The selector appears before the {. In the above example, the selector applies the rule to all &lt;p&gt; elements. Any HTML element type can be used as a selector. For example, the following properties set the background color of the &lt;body&gt; element to black and the text color to white. body { background-color: black; color: white; } Two common selectors are selection by ID and by class. Recall that the HTML attribute id can be used to assign a unique name to an element, and the HTML attribute class can be used to group elements that share something in common together under a shared name. To apply a CSS rule to an element with a particular ID, the # symbol is placed before the ID. #table-of-contents { width: 500px; } To apply a CSS rule to all elements that belong to a particular class, the . symbol is placed before the class name. .navigation-link { color: blue; } Inside the { } appear a list of style rules that are applied to all elements that match the selector. The set of style rules is enormous, so the important thing is not to memorize different rules that could be applied, but rather to understand the concept of applying rules to elements based on selectors. 1.2.2.1 Where does CSS go in a document? There are three places where CSS typically appears in an HTML document. Each of these places is equally valid, and the choice of where to include CSS depends on what is easiest. Often CSS will exist in all three locations in a single document. 1.2.2.1.1 External CSS file One option is to create a separate .css file and load the file in the HTML document via a &lt;link&gt; tag in the &lt;head&gt; element. styles.css body { width: 600px; } p { font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; } webpage.html &lt;head&gt; &lt;link href=&quot;styles.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;/link&gt; &lt;/head&gt; The &lt;link&gt; tag has a few attributes that need to be set. The href attribute is the path to the source file. This path is relative to the location of the .html file that the &lt;link&gt; is in. If the .html and .css files are in the same folder, then just the name of the .css file is sufficient. The rel and type attributes both describe what kind of content is being loaded. 1.2.2.1.2 &lt;style&gt; tag Another option is to include a &lt;style&gt; tag in the &lt;head&gt; element of the document. &lt;head&gt; &lt;style&gt; body { width: 600px; } p { font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; } &lt;/style&gt; &lt;/head&gt; 1.2.2.1.3 style attribute HTML elements also support the style attribute, allowing styles to be set within the tag itself. &lt;body style=&quot;width:600px&quot;&gt; &lt;p style=&quot;font-size:18px; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;The start of a paragraph...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/body&gt; This method is a little bit different than the first two, because there is no selector or { } to define the rule. That’s because the style attribute of an element only applies to that element. This method of adding style can be useful when there is only a single element that needs the style rule. This method is also used a lot by jsPsych because (as will become clear much later in the book) it is a relatively easy way to embed style information in JavaScript code that is generating HTML content. 1.2.3 JavaScript JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages. Originally created to enable dynamic and interactive content in websites, JavaScript is now used for both websites and general purpose programming. JavaScript is still the dominant language of the web because it is understood by all the major web browsers and is enabled by default. Some of the things that you can do with JavaScript include: Changing HTML and CSS of a website in response to events. For example, a short JavaScript program make it so that when a user clicks a button an image on the page is changed to a new image. Controlling HTML and CSS will be one of the primary ways in which JavaScript is used when building online experiments. Recording data about how a user interacts with a webpage. JavaScript has access to information like what keys are being pressed on a keyboard and where the mouse is on the screen. It also has access to the time that these events occur. Sending and retrieving data from other applications on the web. For example, JavaScript can communicate with a database to store and access data. Learning JavaScript is a much bigger task than learning HTML or CSS, but you don’t need to master JavaScript to start using jsPsych. If you learn a few features of the language and understand how JavaScript interacts with HTML and CSS then you’ll be able to start programming the experiments in this book. 1.2.3.1 The JavaScript language 1.2.3.1.1 Comments In JavaScript, every bit of text is either a comment or code. Comments are there only for the benefit of the programmer or anyone else reading the code. They are ignored by the JavaScript engine. To comment text on a single line, use two forward slashes // // this is a comment To comment multiple lines of text, use /* at the start and */ at the end. /* this is a comment and so is this */ 1.2.3.1.2 Variables Variables are a way to store information. To store the value 3 in the variable x, we can do the following. var x = 3; var, short for variable, is how we declare that something is a variable. The = sign is called the assignment operator. In this case we would say that we are assigning the value 3 to the the variable x. In addition to numbers, two other common kinds of values that are assigned to variables are set of characters (called strings) and the boolean values true and false. Strings are created by placing the set of characters inside either single quotes ' ' or double quotes &quot; &quot;. Either one is acceptable, but the starting and ending quote type need to match. var my_string = &#39;hello, reader!&#39;; var are_we_there_yet = false; Changing the value of a variable that already exists works almost the same as creating a variable, except that you don’t need the var keyword, because JavaScript already understands that the name refers to a variable. are_we_there_yet = true; 1.2.3.1.3 Arrays Arrays allow related data to be stored together in a single variable. var months_of_the_year = [&#39;January&#39;, &#39;February&#39;, &#39;March&#39;, &#39;April&#39;, &#39;May&#39;, &#39;June&#39;, &#39;July&#39;, &#39;August&#39;, &#39;September&#39;, &#39;October&#39;, &#39;November&#39;, &#39;December&#39;]; They are created with square brackets [ ] and commas separating each value. Information in an array is accessed by putting the index of the desired position in the array inside the [ ]. To get the first item in the array: months_of_the_year[0]; // outputs &#39;January&#39; Note that array indices begin with 0, not 1. Though sometimes confusing, this is standard practice in most programming languages. 1.2.3.1.4 Objects Objects also allow related data to be stored together, but unlike arrays each bit of data in an object is named. var person = { name: &#39;John Doe&#39;, age: 35, employed: false } There are two primary ways to access the data stored in an object. Dot notation uses a . after the variable name. person.name; // outputs &#39;John Doe&#39; Bracket notation uses square brackets with the name of the property inside the brackets. person[&#39;name&#39;] // also outputs &#39;John Doe&#39; 1.2.3.1.5 Operators Operators perform assignment, arithmetic, comparison, or logical operations between different values. One operator that has already appeared above is the assignment operator, =. It takes the value on it’s right and stores it in the variable on the left. Values can be assigned to normal variables, arrays, or objects. var name = &#39;Jane&#39;; var person = {}; person.name = &#39;Jane&#39;; var people = []; people[0] = &#39;Jane&#39;; Arithmetic operators perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division: var four = 2 + 2; var five = 8 - 3; var six = 3 * 2; var seven = 21 / 3; Comparison operators are used to check if two values are equal, or if there is a particular kind of difference between values. == checks for equality 4 == 5; // false var four = 4; 4 == four; // true != checks for inequality 4 != 5; // true var four = 4; 4 != four; // false &gt; checks if the left value is greater than the right. &gt;= checks if the left value is greater than or equal to the value on the right. var four = 4; 4 &gt; four; // false 4 &gt;= four; // true &lt; checks if the left vaue is less than the right. &lt;= checks if the left value is less than or equal to the value on the right. var four = 4; four &lt; 5; // true 4 &lt; 3; // false Logical operators determine whether there is a particular relationship between values. &amp;&amp; checks if the value on the left AND the value on the right are both true. true &amp;&amp; true; // true 3 &gt; 2 &amp;&amp; 1 == 1; // true var three = 3; var five = 5; three &lt; 2 &amp;&amp; five &gt; 4; // false || checks if the value on the left OR the value on the right is true. true || false; // true; 3 &lt; 2 || 1 != 1; // false; var three = 3; var five = 5; three &lt; 2 || five &gt; 4; // true; ! inverts the truth value of whatever appears on the right. !(1 == 1); // false !(2 &lt; 1); // true var x = true; !x; // false 1.2.3.1.6 Functions Functions, sometimes also called methods, are self-contained sets of code that can be invoked through a name given to the function. // create a function function addTwo(x){ return x + 2; } // invoke the function addTwo(6); // outputs 8 Functions are created via the function keyword. Functions can have 0 or more parameters. In the example above, addTwo has one parameter called x. This parameter is defined by putting the desired name of the parameter inside the ( ) that occur immediately after the name of the function. Inside the body of the function, the code between the { }, x takes on whatever value is used when the function is called. If the function call is addTwo(6), then x is 6. If the function call is addTwo(1), x is 1. The output of a function is specified by the return keyword. In the addTwo function, the statement x + 2 is evaluated and the resulting value is the output of the function. The output can be stored in a variable. var output = addTwo(1); 1.2.3.1.7 Control Statements 1.2.3.2 JavaScript + HTML/CSS JavaScript is the tool that can turn a static website into an interactive one. JavaScript can alter the HTML and CSS of a website, allowing it to indirectly control what appears on the website and how it looks. There are several different approaches for using JavaScript to control the HTML and CSS of a website, and this section only covers a few of the most common. A powerful JavaScript function is .querySelector(). This function works in a similar way to CSS selectors. You can provide a selector, and the function will return the first HTML element that matches the selector. Unlike CSS selectors, with .querySelector you have to specify a root element, which is the HTML element that querySelector will search in. If you want to search the entire page, you can use the document root element. .querySelector() selects an HTML element, which can then be modified in a few different ways. One task that you might want to accomplish is to change the content of that element, and one way to accomplish this is to change the .innerHTML property of the element. Another task is modifying some aspect of the style of the element. All the style properties of an element can be accessed with .style and then the property name. For example, the following code changes the background color of the &lt;body&gt; element. document.querySelector(&#39;body&#39;).style.backgroundColor = &#39;red&#39;; 1.2.3.3 Where does JavaScript go in a document? Like with CSS, there are several ways to include JavaScript in an .html document. 1.2.3.3.1 &lt;script&gt; tag with src attribute JavaScript can be stored in a separate .js file and then loaded into a document using the &lt;script&gt; tag. code.js function changeColor(){ if(document.querySelector(&#39;body&#39;).style.backgroundColor == &#39;white&#39;){ document.querySelector(&#39;body&#39;).style.backgroundColor = &#39;black&#39;; } else { document.querySelector(&#39;body&#39;).style.backgroundColor = &#39;white&#39;; } } webpage.html &lt;head&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;code.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/head&gt; The src attribute provides the path to the .js file, relative to the location of the .html file that contains the &lt;script&gt; element. If the .html and .js files are in the same folder, then the filename alone is sufficient. The example above creates a function changeColor() which will change the background-color style rule for the &lt;body&gt; element every time it is called. If the current color is white then it changes to black; otherwise it changes to white. This function, once loaded via the &lt;script&gt; tag, can be called by other JavaScript code in the HTML document. 1.2.3.3.2 &lt;script&gt; tag with embedded content The &lt;script&gt; tag can also be used without the src attribute, placing the JavaScript directly inside the tag instead. &lt;head&gt; &lt;script&gt; function changeColor(){ if(document.querySelector(&#39;body&#39;).style.backgroundColor == &#39;white&#39;){ document.querySelector(&#39;body&#39;).style.backgroundColor = &#39;black&#39;; } else { document.querySelector(&#39;body&#39;).style.backgroundColor = &#39;white&#39;; } } &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/head&gt; This has the equivalent effect of the first example. The &lt;script&gt; tag does not necessarily need to appear in the &lt;head&gt; section. Often the &lt;script&gt; tag is placed after the end of the &lt;body&gt;, in order to have the content in the &lt;body&gt; tag load first. In the minimal HTML document, it would look like this. &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt;A bare-bones HTML document&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;script&gt; // JavaScript code can be placed here &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/html&gt; 1.2.3.3.3 In certain attributes Some HTML attributes support JavaScript code embedded right in the HTML tag declaration. However, this is mostly an outdated approach at this point, and this method is not recommended. It’s mentioned here in case you come across it. An example of this approach is the onclick attribute of a &lt;button&gt; element. &lt;button onclick=&quot;changeColor();&quot;&gt;Click me!&lt;/button&gt; Every time the button is clicked the JavaScript function changeColor will be called. This function would be defined in a &lt;script&gt; tag elsewhere in the document. The JavaScript code is not limited to calling a single function. In theory, many statements could be executed by the button click, but in practice most programmers find that trying to embed long bits of JavaScript in HTML attributes produces difficult to read code.

["setting-up-your-first-experiment.html", "2.1 Setting up your first experiment", " 2.1 Setting up your first experiment This section is a mini-tutorial that explains how to setup a very basic jsPsych experiment. The goal is to quickly get an experiment running so that you can see what a complete working experiment involves. Explanations of why certain steps are being taken are deliberately brief, and subsequent sections of this chapter will go into much more detail. 2.1.1 Step 1. Create a folder for your experiment. Pick any location on your computer and create a new folder. You can call the folder whatever you like, such as FirstExperiment. Inside this folder create another folder called jspsych. 2.1.2 Step 2. Download the jsPsych library. The jsPsych library is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/jspsych/jspsych. You can download the latest release on the releases page of the GitHub repository. Under each release you will see three files. Two are Source Code (zip) and Source Code (tar.gz). The other begins with jspsych- and ends with a version number. At the time of writing, the current release is v6.0.5 so the file to download is jspsych-6.0.5.zip. Once this file has downloaded, open the ZIP archive and move all of the files to the jspsych folder that you created in the previous step. 2.1.3 Step 3. Create a new HTML file. Open your coding-friendly text editor of choice (see SECTION 1.XXX if you don’t have an editor) and create a new file. In this file, create a [minimal HTML] document using the following code. &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;script&gt; &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/html&gt; Save this file as experiment.html inside the FirstExperiment folder. 2.1.4 Step 4. Load the jsPsych library. Recall from SECTION XXX that JavaScript can be loaded from external .js files by including a &lt;script&gt; tag in the &lt;head&gt; section of an HTML document. To load jsPsych, add a &lt;script&gt; tag to the experiment.html file, with the src attribute linking to the jspsych.js file in the jspsych folder. &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;jspsych/jspsych.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;script&gt; &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/html&gt; something here about folder paths? At least one plugin file is required to create an experiment. Load the html-button-response plugin by adding a &lt;script&gt; tag that points to the jspsych-html-button-response.js file in the jspsych/plugins folder. &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;jspsych/jspsych.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;jspsych/plugins/jspsych-html-button-response.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;script&gt; &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/html&gt; Note that plugins should always be loaded after the main jspsych.js file is loaded. 2.1.5 Step 5. Create a welcome screen. This simple experiment will a single screen, welcoming the participant to the experiment. There will be a button that the participant can click to continue (which will end the experiment). To create the welcome screen, create a JavaScript object called welcome. The object needs a few parameters, shown below. This code can be placed inside the &lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt; section of the HTML file. var welcome = { type: &#39;html-keyboard-response&#39;, stimulus: &#39;Welcome to the experiment!&#39;, choices: [&#39;Continue&#39;] } The type parameter tells jsPsych which plugin is being used to construct the trial. In Step 4, you added a &lt;script&gt; tag to load the html-button-response plugin, and now the plugin is being used to construct this trial. Each plugin has a set of parameters. Two of the parameters for the html-button-response plugin are stimulus and choices. stimulus controls what content is displayed on the screen above the button. The plugin expects the stimulus to be a string, which may include HTML tags. choices is an array of labels for the buttons. In this example, there is a single button with the label 'Continue'. 2.1.6 Step 6. Create a timeline and add the welcome screen. A jsPsych experiment is defined by its timeline. The timeline is covered in depth later in this chapter. For now, think of the timeline as an ordered list of trials. After a trial is complete, the experiment progresses to the next trial in the timeline. The jsPsych timeline is created by adding trial objects, like the welcome object above, to an array. Create an empty array, and then add the welcome object like this. var timeline = []; timeline.push(welcome); 2.1.7 Step 7. Start the experiment! Once the timeline is created the experiment can begin. To start the experiment, call the function jsPsych.init(). This function takes an object of parameters. The only required parameter is timeline. The value of this parameter is the array created in the previous step. jsPsych.init({ timeline: timeline }); 2.1.8 The completed experiment. Here’s what the completed code looks like: &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;jspsych/jspsych.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;jspsych/plugins/jspsych-html-button-response.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;script&gt; var welcome = { type: &#39;html-keyboard-response&#39;, stimulus: &#39;Welcome to the experiment!&#39;, choices: [&#39;Continue&#39;] } var timeline = []; timeline.push(welcome); jsPsych.init({ timeline: timeline }); &lt;/script&gt; &lt;/html&gt; You can run the experiment by opening the experiment.html file with a web browser.
