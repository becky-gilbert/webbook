## Experiment: Estimating Visual Perception Thresholds with an Random-Dot Kinematogram (RDK) Task

Present RDK trials with an adaptive staircase procedure. Trials begin with a high coherence (easy, close to 1) level, and the coherence level on subsequent trials depends on performance: the task becomes more difficulty after N correct responses, and becomes less difficult after N incorrect responses. This is used to estimate the coherence values that correspond to a particular performance level (e.g. 70% correct responses) for each participant. There are separate adaptive tracks and threshold estimates for two different conditions: low contrast (more similar dot and background colors) and high contrast (less similar colors). 

At the end of the task, a performance chart is shown with the conherence values across trials for the two conditions (low and high contrast).
