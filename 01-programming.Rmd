# Programming for the Web

This chapter provides a high-level overview of programming for the web. It is intended for readers who have never done any web development. It covers the core concepts of web-based programming, which can be mysterious for new web developers. It also explains how websites are published and gives some advice about the tools that you will want to have on your computer to support effective web development.

This chapter won't teach you how to program. However, it should make learning to program a bit easier by clarifying how all the pieces of a website fit together. Chapter 2 won't assume that you have any programming experience, so one way to learn is to build the experiments in this book, perhaps experimenting with changes to the examples to test and extend your knowledge. Another approach would be to spend some time learning the basics of web programming before moving on to Chapter 2. There are plenty of high-quality online courses and tutorials that teach the basics.

## How a website works

When you open a browser and type in the URL of this book (http://book.jspsych.org) lots of things have to happen in order for you to see the website. A connection is established between your computer and another computer that "serves" the website. One or more files are then transferred from the server to your computer. These files include HTML documents, CSS stylesheets, JavaScript files, and media elements like audio files and images. As a developer, your role is to create all of the files that are needed to render the website as you want it.

A crticial point to remember as a new web developer is that it is the job of the web browser to transform this set of files into a website. As a developer, you are providing a (very detailed) "recipe" and the browser is assembling the final dish. Fortunately, browsers are far more precise than chefs and usually websites look the same regardless of which browser is doing the rendering. This is thanks to a commonly agreed upon set of standards that browser developers follow. However, these standards have some ambiguity and as a result there are times when a website will look exactly like you want it to in one browser but not in another.

## The three languages of web development 

One of the challenging aspects of web development is that the programmer needs to know three different languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each language is responsible for a different kind of information that the web browser needs in order to render the final website. HTML defines the structure of the elements on a website, such as the presence of text and images. CSS controls how those elements look. If you want to change the size of an image, the color of a background, or the font of a paragraph, you'll be using CSS. HTML and CSS are both markup languages. **[Need description of what that means]**. JavaScript, on the other hand, is a true programming language. In addition to all the normal kinds of computation that programming langauges generally allow, JavaScript is especially good at interacting with HTML and CSS. JavaScript can manipulate the HTML and CSS of a website, allowing the programmer to specify rules about when certain elements on the page should be added or removed (manipulating HTML) and when their appearance should change (manipulating CSS). These interactions can produce very simple results, such as changing the size of an image when the user clicks on it, or very complex ones, such as the development of a video game entirely in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

To create a simple experiment in jsPsych, you only need to have a basic familiarity with JavaScript. There is minimal HTML and CSS in the first few experiments in this book. However, if you want maximal flexibility over what content is in the screen and how it appears, you will need to become familiar with HTML and CSS. As you will discover, jsPsych is designed to allow users who are comfortable manipulating HTML and CSS full control over the output. **[possible figure here with two different jsPsych examples, one simple one fancy]**.

### HTML

HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) defines the elements that exist on a webpage. For example, the HTML below defines two paragraphs.

```html
<p>This is the text in paragraph one.</p>
<p>This is the text in paragraph two.</p>
```

HTML uses *tags* -- like `<p>` and `</p>` above -- to define elements. The type of element is defined by the text in the tag. `<p>` tags create paragraphs, `<img>` tags create images, and `<audio>` tags create audio. Elements begin with the type of element in `< >` brackets, and end with the same tag plus a backslash: `</ >`.

HTML defines **a lot** of different elements. **[maybe a link here?]**. But you don't need to know all or even most of these to get started with HTML. As long as you understand a few ideas about how to use HTML, you'll be able to understand HTML markup and modify it to suit your needs.

#### HTML attributes

HTML tags often have additional attributes that control additional properties of the element. One attribute of the `<img>` tag is the `src`, which defines the source of the image. The `<img>` tag below has the `src` attribute set to the URL of the jsPsych logo.

```html
<img src="https://www.jspsych.org/img/jspsych-logo.jpg"></img>
```

Attributes are declared by putting a space between the tag name and the attribute name and `=` after the attribute. The value to the right of the `=` will be assigned to that attribute. Tags can have multiple attributes separated by a space. The `alt` attribute for an `img` tag is used to describe the *alternate text* that would replace the image for users using screen readers or other assistive devices.

```html
<img src="https://www.jspsych.org/img/jspsych-logo.jpg" alt="jsPsych logo"></img>
```

Two very useful attributes to know are `id` and `class`. These are both ways to identify elements on the page so that JavaScript and CSS can interact with them more easily. `id` values should typically be unique, and are used when CSS or JavaScript needs to target one particular element on a page. `class` values can be applied to many elements on a page, and are used when CSS or JavaScript needs to interact with all the instances of a particular set of elements.

#### Nesting elements in HTML

Elements in HTML can be nested within other elements. For example, a link to another website may be nested within a paragraph.

```html
<p>Please see the <a href="https://www.jspsych.org">jsPsych documentation</a> for more information.</p>
```

An important aspect of nesting elements is that the inner-most element (`<a>` above) must be closed before the element that contains it is closed. The following is wrong because the `<p>` element is closed before `<a>`, but `<a>` started after `<p>`.

```html
<p>Visit <a href="https://www.jspsych.org">jsPsych.org</p></a>
```

Nesting allows HTML to naturally reflect the hierarchical structure of a webpage. Webpages often have distinct sections, like navigation and content, that contain many elements. The `<div>` element is used to create arbitrary divisions of the page.

```html
<div id="table-of-contents">
  <a href="chapter-1.html">Chapter 1</a>
  <a href="chapter-2.html">Chapter 2</a>
</div>
<div id="content">
  <p>It all began...</p>
  <p>And then ...</p>
  <p>The end.</p>
</div>
```

#### A bare-bones HTML document.

If you create a text file with a few words in it, save it as a `.html` file, and open it in a web browser you'll find that it is displayed as a web page. In some sense, a file of text is a minimal HTML file. However, most HTML files have a standard set of sections that look something like this.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>A bare-bones HTML document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

The above has a few HTML-elements, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<title>`, and `<body>`, as well as something that looks like an HTML element -- `<!DOCTYPE html>` but is actually a declaration to the web browser about what kind of document this is and what the root element of the document is. In this case `<html>` serves as the root element, which is standard practice.

`<head>` defines the head-section of the document, which can contain information about the page that is not directly rendered in the visible page. An example of this is the `<title>` element, which controls the title that is displayed in the window or tab of the web browser.

`<body>` is the element that contains all of the content that will be displayed.

### CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a markup language that defines the visual appearance of elements on a webpage. For example, this CSS rule declares that all text in `<p>` tags will be displayed with a 24px font and in red.

```css
p { font-size: 24px; color: red; }
```

CSS rules require the use of a *selector*. The selector defines the set of elements that the rule applies to. The selector appears before the `{`. In the above example, the selector applies the rule to all `<p>` elements. Any HTML element type can be used as a selector. For example, the following properties set the background color of the `<body>` element to black and the text color to white.

```css
body { background-color: black; color: white; }
```

Two common selectors are selection by ID and by class. Recall that the HTML attribute `id` can be used to assign a unique name to an element, and the HTML attribute `class` can be used to group elements that share something in common together under a shared name. To apply a CSS rule to an element with a particular ID, the `#` symbol is placed before the ID.

```css
#table-of-contents { width: 500px; }
```

To apply a CSS rule to all elements that belong to a particular class, the `.` symbol is placed before the class name.

```css
.navigation-link { color: blue; }
```

Inside the `{ }` appear a list of style rules that are applied to all elements that match the selector. The set of style rules is enormous, so the important thing is not to memorize different rules that could be applied, but rather to understand the concept of applying rules to elements based on selectors.

#### Where does CSS go in a document?

There are three places where CSS typically appears in an HTML document. Each of these places is equally valid, and the choice of where to include CSS depends on what is easiest. Often CSS will exist in all three locations in a single document.

##### External CSS file

One option is to create a separate `.css` file and load the file in the HTML document via a `<link>` tag in the `<head>` element.

_styles.css_
```css
body { width: 600px; }

p { font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; }
```

_webpage.html_
```html
<head>
  <link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"></link>
</head>
```

The `<link>` tag has a few attributes that need to be set. The `href` attribute is the path to the source file. This path is relative to the location of the `.html` file that the `<link>` is in. If the `.html` and `.css` files are in the same folder, then just the name of the `.css` file is sufficient. The `rel` and `type` attributes both describe what kind of content is being loaded.

##### `<style>` tag

Another option is to include a `<style>` tag in the `<head>` element of the document.

```html
<head>
  <style>
    body { width: 600px; }
    p { font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; }
  </style>
</head>
```

##### `style` attribute

HTML elements also support the `style` attribute, allowing styles to be set within the tag itself.

```html
<body style="width:600px">
  <p style="font-size:18px; font-weight: bold;">The start of a paragraph...</p>
</body>
```

This method is a little bit different than the first two, because there is no selector or `{ }` to define the rule. That's because the style attribute of an element only applies to that element. This method of adding style can be useful when there is only a single element that needs the style rule. This method is also used a lot by jsPsych because (as will become clear much later in the book) it is a relatively easy way to embed style information in JavaScript code that is generating HTML content.
